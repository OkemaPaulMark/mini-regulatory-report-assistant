# Mini Regulatory Report Assistant

A full-stack AI tool that automates the extraction of structured information from medical reports, providing insights such as drugs used, adverse events, severity, and patient outcomes. The system also supports optional translation of outcomes into French and Swahili.

---

## Project Overview

The Mini Regulatory Report Assistant allows users to:

- Detect **drugs** mentioned in a medical report.
- Identify **adverse events** experienced by patients.
- Classify **severity** (mild, moderate, severe).
- Determine **outcome** (recovered, ongoing, fatal).
- Save reports in a **database** for history tracking.
- Optionally translate outcomes into **French** or **Swahili**.

The project integrates **rule-based extraction** and **Hugging Face NLP models** in a FastAPI backend with a **React + Tailwind CSS frontend**.

## Features

### Backend
### Backend

- **POST `/process-report`** – Extracts structured data (drug, adverse events, severity, outcome) from a medical report and saves it to the database.  
- **POST `/translate`** – Translates all fields of a processed report into French (`fr`) or Swahili (`sw`).  
- **GET `/reports`** – Retrieves all processed reports from the database.  
- **Hugging Face NER** – Detects drugs, chemicals, diseases, and symptoms for accurate extraction.  
- **Rule-based Fallback** – Uses regex and keyword rules to detect drugs, adverse events, severity, and outcome if NER fails.  

### Frontend
- **Input Form**: Paste medical reports for processing.
- **Results Display**: View extracted data (drug, adverse events, severity, outcome).
- **Responsive UI** with Tailwind CSS.
- **Additional Features**: Translate outcome, view history, simple charts.

## Future Improvements

- Integrate **LangChain** to extract structured, JSON-formatted medical data using LLMs.
- Combine **Hugging Face medical NER models** with LLM reasoning for high accuracy.
- Add **multi-language support** for all extracted and translated fields.
- Build **visual analytics dashboards** (charts for diagnosis trends, severity rates).
- Deploy the full system to **Heroku**, **Vercel**, or **Render** for public access.
